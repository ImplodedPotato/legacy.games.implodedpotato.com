A web site where a potato which has been imploded host games to be played on the web!

## Avaible Games

## How Are These Made?

All of these games are either coded in C or C++ with framworks, such as [Raylib](https://raylib.com) or [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). 
I then use [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to port the game to the web
